# Predicting/Classifying Cancer with Machine Learning

## General Information
Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, 
making it a major/significant public health problem in our society.
Using the dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository for breast cancer, I
built several simple but efficient models to classify/predict
if a cancer is malignant or benign.

## Installation
Create a virtual env, then
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all required libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- scikit-learn


```bash
pip install <package_name>
```

Activate virtual env and `cd` into directory.
